The first release of the new Satellite application stack will soon be ready (at which point this notice will be removed) but until then expect that things will be moved around, changed, and deleted without warning.

# Satellite Community UI

Community UI is a [NIP-29](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/29.md) compatible Discord-like social frontend for managing and interacting with one or more [public Satellite nodes](https://github.com/satellite-earth/public-node).

It's bundled by [Satelite Desktop](https://github.com/satellite-earth/desktop) but can also be run standalone in a web browser.
